# Sign-Language-Detection

👐 AI-Powered Real-Time Gesture Recognition

Developed a real-time Sign Language Detection System using YOLOv5 and MediaPipe for fast, accurate, and lightweight hand gesture recognition. This project enhances communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language into text.

Project Overview:
Sign language is essential for communication, but barriers exist for those unfamiliar with it. This system combines YOLOv5 for object detection with MediaPipe's efficient hand tracking to recognize and classify sign language gestures in real-time. By training the model on ASL (American Sign Language) datasets, it ensures high-speed, accurate, and efficient detection.

Key Features:
✔️ Real-Time Gesture Recognition – Uses a webcam for instant sign detection
✔️ YOLOv5 for Object Detection – High-accuracy sign recognition
✔️ MediaPipe Hand Tracking – Lightweight and efficient framework for gesture analysis
✔️ Computer Vision Integration – OpenCV-based preprocessing
✔️ User-Friendly Interface – Converts detected gestures into readable text
✔️ Optimized Model Performance – Fine-tuned for speed and accuracy

Tech Stack:
🔹 Python – PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
🔹 Deep Learning – YOLOv5 for object detection
🔹 MediaPipe – Hand tracking and feature extraction
🔹 Dataset – Custom-labeled ASL dataset

Future Enhancements:
🔹 Voice Integration – Convert detected text into speech for better accessibility
🔹 Mobile & Web Deployment – Extend functionality to smartphones and browsers
🔹 Phrase & Sentence Recognition – Detect complete sentences beyond single gestures

This project integrates YOLOv5, MediaPipe, and AI-powered vision to create an efficient real-time sign language recognition system, breaking communication barriers and promoting inclusivity.
